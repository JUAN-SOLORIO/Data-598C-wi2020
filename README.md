## NFL Play-by-Play Season Data forecasting Postseason Performance

Using data obtained from 'http://nflsavant.com/about.php', which provided data from 2013 to 2019 about the 'Play-by-Play' description of each NFL game from Week 1 to the Super Bowl. I plan to predict the teams that will make the post season and how those will perform in the playoffs.
