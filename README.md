## NFL Play-by-Play Season Data forecasting success of a play and drive

Using data obtained from 'http://nflsavant.com/about.php', which provided data from 2013 to 2019 about the 'Play-by-Play' description of each NFL game from Week 1 to the Super Bowl. I plan to predict the likelyhood a play will succeed in gaining yards and that a drive will end in points (touchdown or field-goal).
